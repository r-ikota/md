I find the movement described in this article interesting:
`Science funders gamble on grant lotteries <https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03572-7>`_

It is difficult to foresee which researche projects will succeed.
So the random assignment of grants might perform better.
This would also reduce workloads of both applicants and assesment panels.

According to Nature's articles, there seem to be some problems with AI at present.
AI could cause disasterous results if it is used in a wrong way.

Every time I hear of the expensive subscription and publication fees for electronic journals, 
I wonder if it would be more cost-effective to use goverment spending for running public open access journals than for paying commercial publishers.
