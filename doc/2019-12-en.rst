I'm now interested in the issues of red tape in scientific activities.
I find these are relevant:

  * `Research performance and bureaucracy within public research labs <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-009-0406-2>`_
  * `Cutting Red Tape: National Strategies (PDF) <http://www.oecd.org/site/govgfg/39609018.pdf>`_
  * `The Standard Cost Model: A framework for defining and quantifying administrative burdens for businesses (PDF) <https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/64157/4374310/11-STANDARD-COST-MODEL-DK-SE-NO-BE-UK-NL-2004-EN-1.pdf/>`_
  * `Bureaucratic complexity and impacts of corruption in utilities <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jup.2008.07.007>`_

Although I don't know how valid they are, such analyses are needed for Japan's science policies, I think.

Since displaying maths in Markdown is a bit too hard, I rewrote the texts in reStructured text and processed them with Sphinx.
I'm thinking of getting the documents to be published on `readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_. 
G. Yamada explained how to do it in *Software Design* (Oct. 2015, in Japanese).

This is a test for math.
Is this :math:`\sin x` displayed correctly?

Surprisingly wsl started to download VScode and then launched it.
I learned that wsl could install VScode.
